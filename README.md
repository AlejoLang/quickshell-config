# Quickshell config
My config for the [Quickshell toolkit](https://quickshell.outfoxxed.me/), taking code inspiration from [soramane config](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell/tree/main).
Made for [Hyprland](https://hypr.land/).

## "Special" packages used
- Material Symbols Font
- bluetoothctl (bluez-utils)
- That's it (for now)
